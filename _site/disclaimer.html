                    <p>3. Restrictions</p>

                    <p>The Websites are only available for individuals aged 18 years or older. If you are 18 or older,
                        but under the age
                        of majority in your jurisdiction, you should review this Agreement with your parent or guardian
                        to make sure
                        that you and your parent or guardian understand it.</p>

                    <p>4. Sign-in Name; Password; Unique Identifiers</p>

                    <p>During the registration process for Registered Users, we will ask you to create an account, which
                        includes a
                        sign-in name (“Sign-In Name”), a password (“Password”), and perhaps certain additional
                        information that will
                        assist in authenticating your identity when you log-in in the future (“Unique Identifiers”).
                        When creating your
                        account, you must provide true, accurate, current, and complete information. Each Sign-In Name
                        and corresponding
                        Password can be used by only one Registered User, and sharing your access credentials with
                        others (especially if
                        they are using your credentials to access our proprietary Content (as defined below)) is a
                        material breach of
                        this Agreement. You are solely responsible for the confidentiality and use of your Sign-In Name,
                        Password, and
                        Unique Identifiers, as well as for any use, misuse, or communications entered through the
                        Websites using one or
                        more of them. You will promptly inform us of any need to deactivate a Password or Sign-In Name,
                        or change any
                        Unique Identifier. We reserve the right to delete or change your Password, Sign-In Name, or
                        Unique Identifier at
                        any time and for any reason and shall have no liability to you for any loss or damage caused by
                        such action.</p>

                    <p>5. Fees and Payment</p>

                    <p>As consideration for any purchase you make on the Websites, you shall pay Company all applicable
                        fees and taxes.
                        We (or our third-party payment processor) shall authorize your credit card, bank account, or
                        other approved
                        payment facility you provided during the registration process for the full payment of the fees
                        and any
                        applicable taxes, and you hereby consent to the same. If the mailing address you provided us is
                        in the United
                        States, all payments will be charged and made in U.S. dollars. If the mailing address you
                        provided us is outside
                        the United States or any of its possessions or territories, all payments will be charged and
                        made in your local
                        currency.</p>

                    <p>There are absolutely NO refunds. All purchases are final.</p>

                    <p>You must provide current, complete, and accurate billing and credit card information. You must
                        promptly update
                        all billing information (such as billing address, card number, and expiration date) to keep your
                        account
                        current, complete, and accurate, and you must promptly contact us if your credit card is lost or
                        stolen, or if
                        you become aware of a potential breach of account security (such as an unauthorized disclosure
                        or use of your
                        Sign-In Name or Password). You hereby authorize Company to obtain or determine updated or
                        replacement expiration
                        dates for your credit card in the event that the credit card you provided us expires. We reserve
                        the right to
                        charge any renewal card issued to you to the same extent as the expired card. If payment is not
                        received from
                        your credit card issuer, you hereby agree to pay all amounts due upon demand. You agree to pay
                        all costs of
                        collection, including attorney’s fees and costs, on any outstanding balance. In certain
                        instances, the issuer of
                        your credit card may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges, which you will be
                        responsible to
                        pay. You are advised to check with your bank and credit card issuer for details.</p>

                        provided by or on
                        behalf of Company (collectively referred to as the “Content”). The Content may be owned by us or

                        The Content is protected under both United States and foreign laws. Unauthorized use of the

                    <p>Visitors may view all publicly-available Content for their own personal, non-commercial use.
                        Registered users who
                        have purchased any product or service, may download onto their own machines and view any Content
                        contained in
                        such purchased product or service for their own personal, non-commercial use. Other than as
                        expressly set forth
                        in the immediately two prior sentences, you have no other rights in or to the Content (other
                        than your own
                        Registered User Content that you post to the Websites), and you will not use the Content except
                        as permitted
                        under this Agreement. No other use is permitted without the prior written consent of Company.
                        Company retains
                        all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the
                        Content. You must
                        retain all copyright and other proprietary notices contained in the original Content. You may
                        not sell,

                        commercial purpose.
                        The use or posting of the Content on any other website, social media page, or in a networked
                        computer
                        environment for any purpose is expressly prohibited.</p>

                    <p>If you violate any part of this Agreement, your permission to access and/or use the Content and
                        the Websites
                        automatically terminates and you must immediately destroy any copies you have made of the
                        Content.</p>

                    <p>The trademarks, service marks, and logos of Company (the “Company Trademarks”) used and displayed
                        on the Websites
                        are registered and unregistered trademarks or service marks of Company. Other company, product,
                        and service
                        names located on the Websites may be trademarks or service marks owned by others (the
                        “Third-Party Trademarks,”
                        and, collectively with Company Trademarks, the “Trademarks”). Nothing on the Websites should be
                        construed as
                        granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use the Trademarks,
                        without our prior
                        written permission specific for each such use. Use of the Trademarks as part of a link to or
                        from any site is
                        prohibited unless establishment of such a link is approved in advance by us in writing. All
                        goodwill generated
                        from the use of Company Trademarks inures to our benefit.</p>

                        not be copied or imitated in whole or in part, by any means, including, but not limited to, the
                        use of framing
                        or mirrors. None of the Content may be retransmitted without our express, written consent for
                        each and every
                        instance.</p>

                    <p>7. Registered User Content; Licenses</p>

                        User Content.
                        You expressly acknowledge and agree that once you submit your Registered User Content for
                        inclusion into the
                        Websites, it will be accessible by others, and that there is no confidentiality or privacy with
                        respect to such
                        Registered User Content, including, without limitation, any personally identifying information
                        that you may make
                        available. YOU, AND NOT Company, ARE ENTIRELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL YOUR REGISTERED USER CONTENT
                        THAT YOU UPLOAD,
                        POST, EMAIL, OR OTHERWISE TRANSMIT VIA THE WEBSITES.</p>

                    <p>You retain all copyrights and other intellectual property rights in and to your own Registered
                        User Content. You
                        do, however, hereby grant us and our sublicensees a non-exclusive, royalty-free, freely

                        profit) your
                        Registered User Content and all intellectual property and moral rights therein throughout the
                        universe, in each
                        case, by or in any means, methods, media, or technology now known or hereafter devised. You also
                        grant us and
                        our sublicensees the right, but not the obligation, to use your Registered User Content, your
                        Sign-In Name,
                        name, likeness, and photograph in connection with any use of the related Registered User Content
                        permitted by
                        the previous sentence and/or to advertise and promote the Websites, Company, and our products
                        and services.
                        Without limiting the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that uses of your Registered User
                        Content, name,
                        likeness, and photograph permitted by the foregoing rights and licenses may include the display
                        of such
                        Registered User Content, name, likeness, and photograph adjacent to advertising and other
                        material or content,
                        including for profit.</p>

                    <p>If you submit Registered User Content to us, each such submission constitutes a representation
                        and warranty to
                        Company that such Registered User Content is your original creation (or that you otherwise have
                        the right to
                        provide the Registered User Content), that you have the rights necessary to grant the license to
                        the Registered
                        User Content under the prior paragraph, and that it and its use by Company and its content
                        partners as permitted
                        by this Agreement does not and will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property or

                        Minnesota without
                        regard to its conflict of laws provisions.&nbsp; You agree that if we are the prevailing party
                        over a dispute on
                        these terms that you will pay our reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs to bring a legal
                        action.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>16. BINDING ARBITRATION</p>

                    <p>In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement, the Content, or the
                        Websites (each, a
                        “Dispute”), either party may elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by binding
                        arbitration
                        governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). &nbsp;Any election to arbitrate, at any time,
                        shall be final
                        and binding on the other party. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE
                        THE RIGHT TO
                        LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN
                        ITS LOCAL SMALL
                        CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S
                        JURISDICTION.
                        &nbsp;ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED
                        IN ARBITRATION.
                        All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose
                        decision will
                        be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be commenced
                        and conducted
                        by JAMS pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules&nbsp;<span
                            style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noreferrer noopener">www.adr.org</a></span>&nbsp;and
                        Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where
                        appropriate, pursuant to
                        JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS’ rules and procedures
                        are available at
                        the JAMS website <a data-auto-recognition="true" href="http://www.jamsadr.com"
                            target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a>. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS
                        filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the
                        arbitrator’s award
                        may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from
                        seeking provisional
                        remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. &nbsp;The arbitration
                        may be conducted
                        in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the
                        arbitration
                        shall take place in the United States. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration,
                        to stay a
                        proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award
                        entered by the
                        arbitrator. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of
                        all
                        non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information)
                        relevant to the
                        Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration. As set forth in Section 18 below,
                        nothing in this
                        Agreement will prevent us from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction
                        as necessary to
                        protect our proprietary interests.</p>

                    <p>17. Class Action Waiver</p>

                    <p>You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you
                        individually. To
                        the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any
                        other; (ii) there is
                        no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to
                        utilize class
                        action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
                        purported
                        representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU
                        MAY BRING
                        CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
                        PURPORTED CLASS
                        OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>

                    <p>18. Equitable Relief</p>

                    <p>You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our
                        intellectual property
                        rights and confidential and proprietary information by you, we will suffer irreparable harm and
                        will therefore
                        be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement. We may, without waiving any other
                        remedies under
                        this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or
                        injunctive
                        relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the
                        arbitration referenced
