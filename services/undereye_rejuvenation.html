                    <p class="mb-4 review">At Simply You under eye restoration is approached with the same
                        science-driven precision we apply to aesthetics and regenerative medicine. We use powerful
                        regenerative therapies like PRP and PDGF treatments, to revitalize the under-eye area, reducing
                        dark circles, fine lines, and hollowness.
                        <br /><br />
                        <em>Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy</em>
                        <br /><br />
                        PRP uses your body's own healing factors to stimulate collagen production which can reduce the
                        appearance of dark circles. This treatment works by drawing a small sample of your blood,
                        isolating the platelet-rich portion, and injecting it in your under-eye area.
                        <br /><br />
                        <em>Platelet Derived Growth Factors (PDGF) Therapy</em>
                        <br /><br />
                        This under eye rejuvenation treatment uses platelet derived growth factors (PDGF) to focus on
                        stimulating collagen and elastin production for improved skin thickness, firmness, and overall
                        appearance. Unlike PRP, PDGF is a lab-engineered, pharmaceutical-grade version, offering
                        consistent results without the need for a blood draw. It's a next-generation solution, offering
                        up to 300,000 times the results of traditional PRP injections, for addressing under-eye hollows,
                        thinning skin, and dark circles. PDGF offers a more natural and longer-lasting solution than
                        traditional fillers or lasers.
