                    <p class="mb-4 review">
                        At Simply You hair restoration is approached with the same science-driven precision we apply to
                        aesthetics and regenerative medicine. Our cutting-edge treatments stimulate hair follicles,
                        restore scalp health, and optimize the environment for stronger, thicker, healthier hair growth.
                        <br /><br />
                        Using a powerful combination of regenerative therapies like PRP or PDGF treatments, along with
                        clinically proven hair supplements, we reignite dormant follicles, improve circulation, and
                        <em>strengthen the foundation of lasting hair health</em>.
                        <br /><br />
                        Because true hair restoration isn't just about growing hair - it's about creating the ideal
                        conditions for long-term strength, density, and vitality.
                        <br /><br />
                        <em>Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy</em>
                        <br />
                        PRP is one of the most effective <em>non-surgical treatments for hair loss</em>. It uses your
                        body's own
                        healing factors to stimulate dormant hair follicles, increase thickness, and enhance scalp
                        circulation. This treatment works by drawing a small sample of your blood, isolating the
                        platelet-rich portion, and injecting it directly into the scalp.
                        <br /><br />
                        <em>Platelet Derived Growth Factors (PDGF) Therapy</em>
                        <br />
                        This hair restoration treatment uses platelet derived growth factors (PDGF) to stimulate dormant
                        hair follicles, increase thickness, and enhance scalp circulation. Unlike PRP, PDGF is a
                        lab-engineered, pharmaceutical-grade version, offering consistent results without the need for a
                        blood draw. It's a next-generation solution, offering up to 300,000 times the results of
                        traditional PRP injections, for addressing hair thinning and loss.

                <span class="review">
                    Since hair naturally grows in cycles, results continue to improve over time. For optimal outcomes, a
                    series of treatments is recommended, followed by annual maintenance.
