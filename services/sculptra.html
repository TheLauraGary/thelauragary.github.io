                    <p class="mb-4 review">Aging is not just about fine lines or wrinkles - it's about the subtle loss
                        of structure, the softening of contours, the quiet retreat of volume that once framed the face
                        with definition and vitality. As collagen declines, the skin no longer holds itself with the
                        same resilience, and the features that once felt naturally lifted may begin to settle. But what
                        if aging wasn't about loss? What if, instead, it was about renewal?<br><br>At Simply You, we
                        believe in beauty that evolves with you, not against you. Sculptra® is more than a filler; it's
                        a regenerative treatment designed to restore youthful volume, redefine contours, and build
                        collagen from within. Unlike traditional fillers that provide instant results and then fade,
                        Sculptra works gradually, stimulating your body's own ability to replenish and rebuild the
                        skin's foundation. The results? A face that doesn't just look refreshed - it feels stronger,
                        firmer, and more supported, as though time itself has softened.<br><br>This is not about
                        reversing age. This is about embracing it on your terms, with confidence.

                <h2>What is Sculptra?</h2>
                <p class="review">Sculptra is not your traditional filler. It is a biostimulatory injectable, meaning
                    that instead of simply adding volume, it triggers your body to rebuild lost collagen over time. Made
                    from poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), a biodegradable compound that has been safely used in medicine for
                    decades, Sculptra works beneath the surface to awaken your skin’s natural regenerative
                    processes.
                    <br><br>
                    Rather than providing instant but temporary volume, Sculptra gradually restores
                    youthful fullness by encouraging the skin to rebuild itself, creating results that evolve naturally
                    and last for years. It does not mask aging - it rewrites the story of your skin from the inside
                    out.
                    <br><br>
                    Sculptra is ideal for individuals who want to correct or prevent volume loss without
                    relying on temporary fillers.
                    <br /><br />
                    It is perfect for:

                    <li>Those experiencing facial hollowing or skin laxity who want a natural, long-term
                        solution.</li>
                    <li>Younger patients looking for collagen preservation to prevent future loss before it
                        happens.</li>
