                    Botox is one of the most popular non-surgical aesthetic treatments—and for good reason. It delivers
                    subtle, effective results that help smooth fine lines and wrinkles without changing your natural
                    facial expression.

                    <b>How Does Botox Work?</b><br />
                    Botox (botulinum toxin type A) works by temporarily blocking nerve signals to the muscles
                    responsible
                    for creating dynamic wrinkles. These are the lines that form from facial movements like frowning,
                    smiling, or squinting. By relaxing these muscles, Botox softens existing wrinkles and prevents new
                    ones
                    from forming.
                </p>

                    <b>Why Consider Botox?</b><br />
                    If you're noticing forehead lines, crow's feet, or the "11s" between your brows, Botox can be a
                    game-changer. It enhances your natural beauty by offering a refreshed and youthful
                    appearance—without
                    looking "frozen."

                    <b>Bonus:</b> Botox isn't just cosmetic. It's FDA-approved for medical conditions like chronic migraines,
                    excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), and jaw tension.
