                    <b>1. Follow Your Post-Treatment Instructions</b><br />
                    Avoid rubbing or massaging the treated area for at least 24 hours. Don't lie down or exercise for 4
                    hours after your appointment. This helps prevent Botox from migrating to unintended areas.

                    <b>2. Maintain a Consistent Treatment Schedule</b><br />
                    Sticking to a regular Botox schedule (every 3-4 months) can help ‚Äútrain‚Äù the muscles to relax more
                    consistently. Over time, you may even need fewer units. Yay!
