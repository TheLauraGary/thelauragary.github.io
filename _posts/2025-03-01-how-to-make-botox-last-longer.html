                    Getting Botox is an investment in your self-confidence. Naturally, you want it to last as long as
                    possible. While Botox typically lasts 3-4 months, these tips can help you extend its effects:

                    <b>1. Follow Your Post-Treatment Instructions</b><br />
                    Avoid rubbing or massaging the treated area for at least 24 hours. Don't lie down or exercise for 4
                    hours after your appointment. These guidelines help prevent Botox from migrating to unintended
                    areas.

                    <b>2. Maintain a Consistent Treatment Schedule</b><br />
                    Sticking to a regular Botox schedule (every 3-4 months) can help “train” the muscles to relax more
                    consistently. Over time, you may even need fewer units.

                    <b>3. Use Medical-Grade Skincare</b><br />
