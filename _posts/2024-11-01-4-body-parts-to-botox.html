                    No more crows feet, smile lines, or wrinkled foreheads, BUT ALSO no more <b>headaches, migraines, TMJ</b>,
                    or excessive <b>sweating</b>?!
                    <br /><br />
                    That's right! <b>Botox</b> isn't just for pretty faces, it also has a wide range of medical applications.
                    <br /><br />
                    Some patients that suffer from <b>chronic headaches / migraines</b> can find relief from botox. Although
                    there are many causes of headaches / migraines, the condition can be irritated by tense face, head,
                    and neck muscles. Botox can be injected around the head and neck to reduce headaches and migraines
                    aggravated by muscle tightness.
                    <br /><br />
                    <b>TMJ</b> (temporomandibular disorder) and <b>jaw tension</b> is often “treated” with a mouth guard. The mouth
                    guard prevents teeth grinding but offers little to prevent the jaw clenching that causes pain. With
                    Botox, the muscles around the jaw can reduce muscle activation resulting in less pain and less teeth
                    grinding. No more jaw pain, botox for the win!
                    ` <br /><br />
                    Constantly dropping things because you have sweaty paws? Reapplying anti-perspirant every 30 mins
                    but still soaking through your t-shirt? Botox can help. Patients with <b>excessive sweating</b>
                    (hyperhidrosis) have over active sweat glands. Botox can be injected into the overactive glands to
                    reduce and control perspiration. Once treated, say goodbye to having to carry an extra blouse to
                    work every day.
                    <br /><br />
                    Although Botox can help with these (and more) medical conditions it is important to speak with your
                    primary care doctor (or your specialist) to ensure any underlying medical conditions are treated.
