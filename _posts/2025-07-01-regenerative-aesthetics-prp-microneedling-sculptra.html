                    <b>What Is Regenerative Aesthetic Medicine?</b><br />
                    It’s an emerging field that stimulates collagen, elastin, and tissue repair. Think of it as
                    rejuvenation from the inside out—with longer-lasting, natural-looking results.

                    <b>1. PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma)</b><br />
                    PRP uses your body's own platelets to accelerate healing. Commonly known as the "vampire facial," it
                    stimulates collagen, tightens skin, and improves texture—especially when combined with
                    microneedling.

                    <b>2. Microneedling</b><br />
                    Microneedling creates controlled micro-injuries in the skin to boost natural healing. It reduces
                    fine lines, acne scars, and uneven tone. Add PRP to boost results.

                    <b>3. Sculptra®</b><br />
                    Unlike hyaluronic fillers, Sculptra stimulates your body to produce collagen over time. Results
                    appear gradually and last up to two years, restoring volume in a soft, natural way.
