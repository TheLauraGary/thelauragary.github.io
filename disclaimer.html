                        or change any
                        Unique Identifier. We reserve the right to delete or change your Password, Sign-In Name, or
                        Unique Identifier at

                        your credit card may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges, which you will be
                        responsible to
                        pay. You are advised to check with your bank and credit card issuer for details.</p>

                        right. We shall provide notice to you of any such claim, suit, or proceeding and shall assist
                        you, at your

                        exclusive defense
                        and control (at your expense) of any matter that is subject to indemnification under this
                        section. In such case,
                        you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting our defense of such matter.</p>

                    <p>15. CONTROLLING LAW</p>

                    <p>This Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of
                        Minnesota without
                        regard to its conflict of laws provisions.&nbsp; You agree that if we are the prevailing party
                        over a dispute on
                        these terms that you will pay our reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs to bring a legal
                        action.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>16. BINDING ARBITRATION</p>

                    <p>In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to this Agreement, the Content, or the
                        Websites (each, a
                        “Dispute”), either party may elect to finally and exclusively resolve the dispute by binding
                        arbitration
                        governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). &nbsp;Any election to arbitrate, at any time,
                        shall be final
                        and binding on the other party. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE
                        THE RIGHT TO
                        LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN
                        ITS LOCAL SMALL
                        CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S
                        JURISDICTION.
                        &nbsp;ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED
                        IN ARBITRATION.
                        All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose
                        decision will
                        be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be commenced
                        and conducted
                        by JAMS pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules&nbsp;<span
                            style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.adr.org/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noreferrer noopener">www.adr.org</a></span>&nbsp;and
                        Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where
                        appropriate, pursuant to
                        JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS’ rules and procedures
                        are available at
                        the JAMS website <a data-auto-recognition="true" href="http://www.jamsadr.com"
                            target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a>. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS
                        filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the
                        arbitrator’s award
                        may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from
                        seeking provisional
                        remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. &nbsp;The arbitration
                        may be conducted
                        in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the
                        arbitration
                        shall take place in the United States. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration,
                        to stay a
                        proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award
                        entered by the
                        arbitrator. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of
                        all
                        non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information)
                        relevant to the
                        Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration. As set forth in Section 18 below,
                        nothing in this
                        Agreement will prevent us from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction
                        as necessary to
                        protect our proprietary interests.</p>

                    <p>17. Class Action Waiver</p>

                    <p>You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you
                        individually. To
                        the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any
                        other; (ii) there is
                        no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to
                        utilize class
                        action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
                        purported
                        representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU
                        MAY BRING
                        CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
                        PURPORTED CLASS
                        OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p>

                    <p>18. Equitable Relief</p>

                    <p>You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our
                        intellectual property
                        rights and confidential and proprietary information by you, we will suffer irreparable harm and
                        will therefore
                        be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement. We may, without waiving any other
                        remedies under
                        this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or
                        injunctive
                        relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the
                        arbitration referenced
                        above. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the personal and subject matter
                        jurisdiction of the
                        federal and state courts in the State of Minnesota for purposes of any such action by us.</p>

                    <p>19. Miscellaneous</p>

                    <p>Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as a
                        waiver of that
                        provision or any other provision in this Agreement. No waiver shall be effective against us
                        unless made in
                        writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance.
                        Except as
                        expressly agreed by us and you in writing, this Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement
                        between you and us
                        with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements,
                        whether written
                        or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter. The section headings are
                        provided merely for
                        convenience and shall not be given any legal import. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of
                        our successors,
                        assigns, licensees, and sublicensees.</p>
