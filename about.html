                        individual goals, prioritizes safety, and delivers natural-looking results. Laura is passionate
                        about continued education and stays at the forefront of advances in technique, products, and
                        patient care.
                        <br /><br />
                        Beyond Simply You, Laura is married to her high school sweetheart and a proud mom to three
                        incredible children. Her life is rooted in family, purpose, and a deep desire to empower others
