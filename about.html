                    <p class="mb-4 review">
                        Laura has over 17 years of experience in healthcare, including aesthetics, critical care,
                        nursing education, and leadership. Known for her clinical expertise, personalized approach, and

                        patient-centered care. Throughout her career, she has worked at leading medical centers and

                        commitment to excellence sets her apart in the field of aesthetic medicine.
                        <br /><br />
                        She believes in a thoughtful, evidence-based approach to treatments, one that respects
                        individual goals, prioritizes safety, and delivers natural-looking results. Laura is passionate
                        about continued education and stays at the forefront of advances in technique, products, and
                        patient care.
                        <br /><br />
                        Beyond Simply You, Laura is married to her high school sweetheart and a proud mom to three
                        incredible children. Her life is rooted in family, purpose, and a deep desire to empower others
                        through confidence and self-care.
                        <br /><br />
